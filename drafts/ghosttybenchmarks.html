        <h1>Some ghostty benchmarks</h1>
        <p>
        recently, i decided to try out that hot new terminal ghostty. i haven't tried it for too long so i dont have that many actual thoughts on it(but i will say: the fact that it doesn't respect my fontconfig is really fucking lame), but I did run some basic terminal benchmarks on it. Here are the results(with other terminals as reference):
