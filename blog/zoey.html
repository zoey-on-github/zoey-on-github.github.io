        a question i get all the time is "why are you named zoey in some places, like github, but julie on most places?"</br>

        the answer, my friend, is both more interesting than you'd think and also just kind of boring.</br>
        
        see, about 5 years ago, i was new to this whole transgender thing and i was kind of just trying out names. julie stuck(obviously), but i tried out a few other names before then. </br>

        <h2>why zoey, then? </h2>
        i used to be really active in this queer discord server(thrilling, i know.), and it was kind of a cliche for members there to be named "zoey", so as part of an inside joke, i decided to name myself zoey also. people kept calling me zoey, so i was like "sure why not, im fine with this as an alternate name i guess". eventually time came to make a github account, and since i was still named zoey on that server and kind of experimenting with names, i decided to go with it as a username.</br>

        <h2>why'd you keep it?</h2>
        two reasons. one, i dont really like changing things like that(ive had the same discord pfp for 5 years). two, it's just kind of nice having a seperate name for my "productive" stuff. something neat about people in PRs calling me one name and people having casual conversations with me calling me another </br>

        <h2>can i call you zoey? </h2>
        No. </br>
        (just call me julie kthx)
