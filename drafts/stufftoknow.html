	<h1>here it is, everything i wish i knew when i started linux(very incomplete)</h1>

	<p>
	this is moreso a loosely organized collection of tips, but there are some things of value in here i'd say.

	<h2> arch stuff </h2>
	<p> you've probably heard people say that you need an AUR helper. and i agree! an aur helper is extremely nice. that said, i don't recommend yay or paru or whatever. the one that i personally prefer is aurutils, this one is extremely neat because it intregrates directly with pacman instead of trying to provide an experience simlar to it, it's a bit more effort to setup but honestly the extra effort is extremely worth it.
	you need to setup a local pacman repository. this might sound really hard but you really just need to edit /etc/pacman.conf and then run a few commands.
